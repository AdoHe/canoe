#canoe

canoe was born to get the simplicity of Hashicorp's raft library with the
full set of features you get with the raft library in etcd.

On the backend, canoe is a wrapper around
[etcd-raft](https://github.com/coreos/etcd/tree/master/raft). 

canoe is currently not considered production ready. There are still
several caveats which need to be worked out.
